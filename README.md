## Installation

This application is live on Heroku and does not require any installation from users (see link in description).

## Usage

The user is first prompted on a home page to enter the note taker. From there, they are taken to a page where they can press the "+" button to open a blank form allowing the user to create a new note by inputting a title and note content, then pressing the "save" icon which will store the note to the list of notes on the left of the screen. When any of the notes from the list are selected, that note populates to the screen. The user can then press the "trash" icon on the notes list to delete that note.
